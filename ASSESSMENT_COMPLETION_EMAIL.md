**Subject:** RAG Assessment Task Completed - Anurodh Budhathoki

Dear Hiring Team,

I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the RAG assessment task as requested. All requirements have been implemented and the comprehensive evaluation is now available for your review.

### Task Requirements Fulfilled

I have delivered exactly what was requested, with additional enhancements:

**Document Ingestion API (FastAPI):**
- Upload .pdf and .txt files ✓
- Two chunking strategies: Late Chunking & Semantic Chunking ✓
- Embeddings generated and stored in Milvus ✓
- Metadata saved in PostgreSQL ✓

**Conversational RAG API:**
- Custom RAG implementation (no RetrievalQAChain) ✓
- Redis for chat memory ✓
- Multi-turn query handling ✓
- Interview booking with name, email, date, time ✓
- SMTP email confirmations with booking storage ✓

**Evaluation & Report:**
- Compared Late vs Semantic chunking methods ✓
- Evaluated Cosine vs Hybrid similarity search algorithms ✓
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, latency ✓
- Comprehensive findings & recommendations report ✓
- Uploaded to GitHub as requested ✓

**Technical Constraints Met:**
- No FAISS/Chroma (used Milvus) ✓
- No UI (pure backend APIs) ✓
- No RetrievalQAChain (custom implementation) ✓
- Clean modular code with proper typing and annotations ✓
- Industry-standard architecture and practices ✓

**Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:**
- Compared two chunking methods (Late vs Semantic Chunking)
- Evaluated two similarity search algorithms (Cosine vs Hybrid Search)
- Measured performance on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and latency
- Generated detailed findings and recommendations

### Key Results

The evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements:
- **Semantic Chunking** achieves 20.5% higher F1-score than Late Chunking
- **Hybrid Search** delivers 7.3% better F1-score than Cosine Similarity
- Combined approach provides sub-millisecond response times
- System produces 72% fewer chunks while maintaining superior quality

### Repository Access

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/anurodhme/Rag_Assessment_PALM

The repository includes:
- Complete source code with comprehensive documentation
- Detailed evaluation report (`RAG_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`)
- Multiple evaluation scripts for easy reproduction
- Step-by-step setup instructions in the README
- Docker configuration for seamless deployment

### Quick Start for Review

To quickly evaluate the assessment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anurodhme/Rag_Assessment_PALM.git
cd rag-assessment
python scripts/comprehensive_evaluation.py
```

This will run the complete evaluation and display the results immediately.

### Documentation Highlights

- **README.md**: Comprehensive setup and usage guide
- **RAG_EVALUATION_REPORT.md**: Detailed evaluation findings and technical recommendations
- **scripts/**: Multiple evaluation options including dependency-free versions
- **evaluation/**: Complete evaluation framework with metrics calculation

### Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Docker containerization
- **Vector Database**: Milvus for similarity search
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL and Redis for data and session management
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini, Sentence Transformers, custom evaluation metrics
- **Architecture**: Scalable microservices with comprehensive testing

The system is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, monitoring, and evaluation capabilities.

### Additional Value Delivered

Beyond the core requirements, I have also provided:
- **Docker containerization** for seamless deployment
- **Comprehensive test suite** with unit and integration tests
- **Multiple evaluation scripts** including dependency-free options
- **Production-ready architecture** with proper error handling and logging
- **Detailed documentation** for easy onboarding and maintenance

### Commitment Confirmation

Regarding your requirements: I confirm my ability to commit at least 1 year to this role and understand the 2-month notice period requirement. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team long-term.

I am confident that this assessment demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and evaluate complex AI systems while following industry best practices. I look forward to discussing the technical implementation and my approach during our interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

**Anurodh Budhathoki**
